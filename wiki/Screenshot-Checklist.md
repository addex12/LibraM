## Tips
1. Use a consistent resolution (e.g., 1440px wide) and light mode.
2. Include the browser address bar only when demonstrating URLs.
3. Save as PNG for clarity; keep filenames lower_snake_case.
4. After adding images, reference them in the relevant wiki pages using Markdown: `![Books List](images/admin-books-list.png)`.
5. Update this checklist whenever you add new modules or flows.
